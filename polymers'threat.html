Polyethene is an example of a polymer, very useful globally, used as plastic bags, computer hardware packaging, toys, and casing. But when it is burnt imcompletely , it produces dioxins (C4H8O2), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and furans (C4H4O). Press the buttons to see the effects of polyethene on the environment :)";
